# Faster_DST

## Description 

This is a third-party patch that replaces the lua engine of the DST linux server with luajit to improve performance. The idea of adoption is similar to paintdream's [DontStarveLuaJIT](https://github.com/paintdream/DontStarveLuaJIT)

## Install/Update

Download latest [Release](https://github.com/CN-DST-DEVELOPER/Faster_DST/releases). Upload to your server and unpack. Go to the extracted folder and execute

```shell
sh ./setup.sh [dst_install_path] install
```

Replace `[dst_install_path]` to your install path of dst, the default path download using Steam is `"/root/.steam/steam/SteamApps/common/Don't Starve Together Dedicated Server"`.

Use `dontstarve_dedicated_server_nullrenderer_x64_luajit` instead `dontstarve_dedicated_server_nullrenderer_x64` in your start game script.

## Uninstall

Execute this command in your extracted folder.

```
sh ./setup.sh [dst_install_path] uninstall
```
